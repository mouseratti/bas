1 )	Ask the user for a number.
 Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

2 )	FizzBuzz game
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
For the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” instead.

3)	 Summarize the powers
With given N count the result of this expression:
1^3+2^3+3^3+...+n^3
4) 	Fibonacci sequence
With given N found the  N-th Fibonacci number. 
For example,  5th number will be 1,1,2,3,5 - > 5
5)	How much time?
With given N seconds from the beginning of the day, show out what time digital watches are showing . The format of output is “HH:mm:ss”

6)	Format sql query
Create an sql query that adds users 
“John Smith: 26”, “Mikhail Koshel: 30”, “Mary Christmas: 6”
Into a table  “users” with columns “name”, “surname”,”age”
7)	Generate configuration keys
Some application  has configuration properties in this format:
/system/configs/project-depcode/[<project-id>]: “<depcode>”
Project id is created from depcode with these rules: 1000<depcode><control-number>
Control number is the last digit of the summary of all previous digits in project-id
For example:
depcode = 61001, project-id = 1000610019, where 9 is the last digit of the sum  1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9
depcode = 61011, project-id = 1000610010, where 0 is the last digit of the sum 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 10
Create config properties for all depcodes from 61001 to 61011
8)	Reverse Word Order

  My name is Michele ->   Michele is name My

The binary number returned should be a string.

16	Descending Order
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
Examples:
Input: 21445 Output: 54421
Input: 145263 Output: 654321
Input: 1254859723 Output: 9875543221

20)	 Rewrite task 3 as a function
21)	Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed.
If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”
Practice 3
22)	Write a function to check if a string contains all letters of the English alphabet

23)	Write a function to create a Caesar encrypted string from a given text.
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

		return x*x
count_sqrt(5) -> 25 # computed
count_sqrt(5) -> 25 # extracted from cache

33) 	Create decorator that hides all vovels characters in outputted text

		return word * 2
	multiple_word(“abc”) -> “*bc*bc”
	multiple_word(“ma”) -> “m*m*”
